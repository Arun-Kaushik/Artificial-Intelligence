## 2D Tic-tac-toe

In this problem, you will implement a program that plays the game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Your goal is to implement a strategy that allows your program to win (or not lose) as often as possible. You will be provided a skeleton which generates a list of valid moves for you to choose from (see section ).

There is an square board 𝐻, consisting of 16 cells. Two players, 𝑋 and 𝑌, take turns marking blank cells in 𝐻. The first player to mark 4 cells along a row wins. Here by a row we mean any 4 cells, whose centres lie along a straight line in 𝐻. So, any horizontal, vertical and diagonal row is winning. In this assignment, our goal is to find the best possible move for player 𝑋 given a particular state of the game.
