# 3D Tic-tac-toe
In this problem, a program that plays the game of Tic-Tac-Toe is implemented. The goal is to implement 
a strategy that allows the program to win (or not lose) as often as possible.

In this assignment a special case of 3-dimensional generalization of Tic-Tac-Toe game is considered. 
The rules are simple. There is a 3-dimensional hypercube H, consisting ofn 43 cells. Two players, X and Y, 
take turns marking blank cells in H. The first player to mark 4 cells along a row wins. Here by a row we mean 
any 4 cells, whose cetres lie along a straight line in H. Winning rows lie along the 48 orthogonal rows (those
which are parallel to one of the edges of the cube), the 24 diagonal rows, or the 4 main diagonals of the cube,
making 76 winning rows in total. Player X always starts the game. In this assignment, the goal is to find the 
best possible move for player X given a particular state of the game within a time limit.
